# Hello Docker World

By now you should already have installed docker (if not, check [https://www.docker.com/get-docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker))

Lets boot your first container:

```
docker run -ti ubuntu 
# -t Allocate a pseudo-TTY
# -i Keep STDIN open
# why ubuntu? fine, debian or alpine or busybox...
```

Feel free to run any commands... you are in a container after all.

```
ls /proc
echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger
shutdown now
```

Run `exit` or hold `ctrl-D` when you are done.

# Wordpress

Ok lets run a real application now.

```
docker run -d -p 80 wordpress
# -d Run container in background and print container ID
# -p Publish a container's port(s) to the host
```

You can easily run multiple instances of wordpress on the same machine.

```
docker run -d -p 80 wordpress
docker run -d -p 80 wordpress
```

Try `docker ps`.
It lists all the running containers.

In the `PORT` column, you should see something like `0.0.0.0:XXXXX->80/tcp`.
Docker randomize the listening port, even if the wordpress applications asked for the same 80 port.

Try to reach the firsts wordpress containers ([http://localhost:XXXX](http://localhost:XXXX)).

You can specify the port like this `docker run -d -p 8080:80 wordpress`.
This container should be reachable through [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Now is good time to look at the following commands:

* `docker logs [id|name]`
* `docker rename [id|name] [newname]` (by default, containers name are adjective_noun)
* `docker stats`
* `docker pause [id|name]` (freezes the processes)
* `docker unpause [id|name]`
* `docker stop [id|name]` (send signal)
* `docker start [id|name]`
* `docker restart [id|name]`
